# Reinforcement Learning - Deep Q Learning from Demonstrations (DQfD)

## Summary
- Bootstrapping an RL model using expert demonstrations has shown to improve overall performance and sample efficiency. 
- This project work analyses how expert demostrations can be used during the online-RL phase after the bootstrapping process. 
- Created and tested different scheduling techniques across multiple physics based games to evaluate their performance. 

## Files
- IRL-DQfD: Implements the DDQN and the DQfD model. Analyses 4 different scheduling techniques: linear annealing, exponential annealing, threshold based annealing and constant. 
- Final_Presentation, IRL_Final_Report: Contains detailed analysis of the comparisons and the final results.
